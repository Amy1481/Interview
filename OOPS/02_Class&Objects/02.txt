Classes & Objects
Objects are entities(any real world ) in the real world
Class is like a blueprint of these entities 
Ex - Let Toyota be an name and it has a blueprint so we can create car1 car2 car3 using the blueprint and these cars are the objects and each one is different from each other.

Ex - Let in college we create system that stores all the information like name,dept,subject & salary about all the teachers.

This information are known as properties/props i.e some values that associates with this entity i.e object.Teacher is the entity which has it's own properties.

There might be some extra functions like changing dept of the teacher so the function is changeDept().Functions are also called as methods hence method is a function which is written inside a class 

Teacher is the the object and and it has properties and functions associated with it 

For classes and objects we create our own functions  

To right this correctly
Class BP 
Obj1 T1
Obj2 T2
Obj3 T3

Syntax of class:
Class Teacher{
    .....
}; 

Syntax of object:
